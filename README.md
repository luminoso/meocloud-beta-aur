# meocloud-beta-aur

AUR package for MeoCloud

MeoCloud is a Portuguesedropbox-like file sync provider from Meo ISP.

This is the PKGBUILD and the simple script to get new md5sums and version.

Since MeoCloud doesn't provide any information about new beta versions the AUR package is updated when users start to complain about package not building.
